# Vex-Net

## What is vexnet?
vexnet is the communication between the robots, controllers, and competition
control

None of these things actually have wireless capabilities, needing wireless
dongles for all wireless capabilities

These dongles do **not** contain any software required to program the vex
cortex controller.

## How Do I get it working?
First, confirm your code works by just plugging in a computer used to flash
the robot, and make sure you have some indication that the code runs.
Then, unplug the computer and plug in the Vex-Net controller to the robot
using the usb cable provided. Confirm the robot works as intended with the
controller by turning both off, then turning the robot on first and then the
controller. Synchronization takes about ten seconds so *be patient*.

Once confirmed that the controller can communicate with the robot, unplug the
usb cable between the controller and the robot, and turn off both. Then, take
your provided vex-net wireless dongles and plug in to both robot and
controller. Turn the robot on first, and then turn on the controller. They
should be all set to go in roughly ten seconds.
